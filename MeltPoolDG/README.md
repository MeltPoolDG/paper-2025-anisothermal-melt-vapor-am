## (DG)-FEM-based multi-phase flow solvers for high-fidelity metal additive manufacturing process simulations

The aim of `MeltPoolDG` is to provide application-oriented, research-driven solvers for modeling the thermo-hydrodynamics in the vicinity of the melt pool during selective laser melting, including melt pool formation and the interaction of the multi-phase flow system (liquid metal/ambient gas/metal vapor). They are and will be based on continuous and discontinuous finite element methods in an Eulerian setting. For interface modeling of the multi-phase flow problem including phase-transition (evporation/melting), diffuse interface capturing schemes such as level set methods and phase-field methods are used. It strongly builds upon the general purpose finite element library [deal.II](https://github.com/dealii/dealii) and the highly efficient, matrix-free two-phase flow solver [adaflo](https://github.com/kronbichler/adaflo). Furthermore, via `deal.II` we access also other important third-party libraries such as `p4est`, `Trilinos` and `Metis`.
